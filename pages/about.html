				<p>We hope that lockdown and the news aren’t getting you too down in the dumps, but if they are, we’re here to change that...</p>

<p>To try and lift everybody’s mood we thought that it might be a nice idea to host an OHBA-art evening at the start of March. This will be a friendly competition where you can show off your creative sides to colleagues. It will also serve as a nice opportunity to re-connect with your old lunchtime buddies. Rather unoriginally, the theme for the evening will be “the brain”, and so we’d love to see your beautiful plots, paintings, drawings or sculptures relating to neuroscience.</p>

<p>In an effort to make this a broad-church event, we have decided on 4 categories under which you can submit your pieces, including a “data” category. This means that any creative digital visualisations of data are truly welcome. You might, for example, make a beautiful plot of an empirical mode decomposition and submit that... A full listing of the categories can be seen below.</p>

<p>You must now all be shouting “Sounds great! Where do I submit my art? Where can I view everybody else’s work? When do I need to submit it by?”. All of this information and more can be viewed on the <a href="https://rctimms.github.io/OHBArt/#faq">FAQ</a>. An exact format as to how the evening will run, and a link to the website hosting the art will be circulated in due course.</p>
			
<p>We can’t wait to see all of your lovely faces.</p>

<p>Giedre, Ryan and Evan.</p>
			

          <h1>Categories</h1>
			<ul>
	  <li>Data - e.g. a cool time-frequency plot, a comodulogram, a conjunction plot, etc.</li>
	  <li>Photos - e.g. some rather pyramidal looking trees.</li>
	  <li>Drawings & Paintings - e.g. "my interpreation of the DMN"</li>
          <li>Everything else - think sculptures, cakes, knitting, etc</li>
